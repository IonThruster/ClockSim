# ClockSim

Clock Based Cycle Accurate Simulation using all best practices

### Some highlights : 
1. Uses Cmake
2. Uses Unit testing using Catch
3. Uses Modern C++11 techniques, Idioms, patterns as much as possible.

### Goals : 
1. Enable rapid prototyping of Architectures
2. Excellent debug-ability and visualization capabilities just like RTL

### Example :
