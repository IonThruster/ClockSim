# CycleSim

Clock Based Cycle Accurate Simulation using all best practices

Some highlights : 
1. Uses Cmake
2. Uses Unit testing using Catch
3. Uses Modern C++11 techniques, Idioms, patterns.

Goals : 
1. Enable rapid prototyping of Architectures
2. Excellent debug-ability and visualization capabilities just like RTL

Example :
